Feature: Pet management
  As a pet owner
  So that I can add, update or remove information about my pet
  I want to be able to manage my pet's information on the platform

  Background: I am logged in
    Given I am a registered user
    And I am logged into my account

Scenario: Add new pet information
  When I navigate to the "Add Pet" page
  And I fill in the pet form with valid information
  And I press "Salvar"
  Then I should see the new pet listed in my pets page

Scenario: Update existing pet information
  Given I have an existing pet registered
  When I navigate to the "Edit Pet" page for that pet
  And I update the pet information with valid data
  And I attach the file "spec/fixtures/files/bee.png" to "Foto do pet"
  And I press "Atualizar"
  Then I should see the updated information in my pets page
