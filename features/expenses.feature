Feature: Expenses page

  As a pet owner
  So that I can control expenses with my pet
  I want to view and register new expenses

  Background:
    Given I am logged in as a valid user
    And I have a pet named "ArcticMonkeysAcoustic"
    And I have some expenses for "ArcticMonkeysAcoustic"

  Scenario: View expense chart  and filters
    When I visit the expenses page
    Then I should see a chart of my expenses
    And I should see filters for "Período" and "Pet"
